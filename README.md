# OpenCV Haar Cascade Face Detector

This project is a simple Python script that uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier from OpenCV to detect human faces in an image. When a face is found, the script draws a green bounding box around it and displays the result.

## Demo

Below is an example of the script successfully identifying a face in an image. The output image is saved to the project folder.

*(You can replace this with a screenshot of your own successful detection)*

## How It Works

The core of this project is the Haar Cascade algorithm, a machine learning object detection method. The `file.xml` is a pre-trained model that contains data on many visual features common to human faces. The `detect.py` script loads this model, scans the input image, and identifies regions that strongly match these facial features.

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Git

### 2. Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
cd your-repository-name
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Or on macOS/Linux
# source venv/bin/activate

Of course. Based on your project structure, here is a complete and professional README.md file.

This README explains what the project does, how to set it up, and importantly, it addresses the reason you got "0 objects found" when using the lion image.

Step 1: Create the README.md file
In your VS Code project (HAAR_PROJECT), create a new file named README.md.

Step 2: Copy and Paste the Code
Copy the entire block of code below and paste it into your new README.md file.

3. Create a Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.



# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Or on macOS/Linux
# source venv/bin/activate
Create a file named requirements.txt with the following content:

opencv-python
Then, install the required package:


pip install -r requirements.txt
How to Run
Open the detect.py script.

Make sure the image_filepath variable points to the image you want to test (e.g., 'lion-animal-isolated-photo.jpg').

Run the script from your terminal:

python detect.py
An image window will pop up showing the result. The output is also saved as detection_output.jpg.
